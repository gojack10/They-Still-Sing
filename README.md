## About

"They Still Sing" is a FNAF fan horror game set in 1986 within a Fazbear Entertainment storage facility. As a night security guard, you must survive your shift while watching over decommissioned animatronics awaiting scrapping. But in the darkness of the facility, something stirs within their decaying shells - echoes of a tragedy that refuses to be forgotten.
